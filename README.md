hi, hope you enjoy my script, you can contact me on discord: "LaptopFreak8888#8888" dm me bug reports or something idk

you can either be in or out of the vehicle when you execute, the ui will open once you enter a vehicle.

the car will not move at first, you'll need to increase the torque and max speed to get moving.

there's also handling and drivetrain options aswell. these you can leave untouched if you want.

if you want to switch cars, click on "misc." and click "DestroyGui". Then re-execute the script. (do this to avoid glitches with the ICE vehicles)
